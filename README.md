## Twitter iOS Clone | Swift 5/Firebase | No Storyboards | MVVM

I built a fully programmatic Twitter Clone for iOS 13 using Swift 5, Firebase and MVVM Architecture

# • Prgrammed model, controller, view/view model structre to implement user:
Logging in/out, 
Fetching feeds, 
Posting/replying/liking tweets, 
Following/Unfollowing,
Notification features.
# • Using Firebase real-time database to design data structure and interact with application's Auth, User, Tweet and Notification services.
